Robert handled the conversion from the pipeline to the scoreboard and implemented the scoreboard itself. He also implemented the branching logic and the Integer Functional Unit.

James handled the Floating Point Functional Units, the expansion of registers to account for floating point operations, and the implementation of the nop and store/load operations.

We collaborated primarily through Skype and email.
