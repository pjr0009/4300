to run we have provided a make file. Just run make then run ./pipeSim then input the assembly file.

make all; echo "lab3c.s" | ./pipeSim

For lab3b.s just enter the word to be checked when prompted, everything else should run without interrupt or issue.


values of total clock cycles, total instructions executed, and number of NOPs are all shown at runtime

For lab3c.s the number of cycles is 14, the number of instructions executed is 8 and the number of nops is 7.
